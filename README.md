#### Current Features
* Keeps youtube video at the top of the screen so you can still see it as you scroll down the page
* Stops the space key from scrolling down the page. Instead it will always play/pause unless 1)the cursor is in the youtube search bar 2)the cursor is hovering over the write comment field.
* Works on all screen sizes
* Works with playlist pannel
* Works with theater mode (requires a page refresh)

#### To do list
* smaller screens (height) and theater mode: make the youtube video smaller so there is more space underneath or disable the scroll feature?
* Issue with space to pause after clicking the video to pause or play.
* Make theater mode work without a page refresh and on small width screen
* make playlists work in theater mode
* opening a comment input box by clicking 'reply' then closing that input box the space bar goes back to default action
* fix playlist goes small if opening playlist then clicking on a video form the playlist
* stop scroll to top when clicking a time link in the comment section.
* video side bar can be seen above playlist pannel when scrolling
